## Study Notes

To see the PropType warnings, use the unminified version of react and react-dom.
You can import these by specifying the module's full path, e.g.

```
const React = require('../../node_modules/react/dist/react')
const ReactDOM = require('../../node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom')
```
